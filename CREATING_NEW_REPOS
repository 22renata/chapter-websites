# Creating New Repos

These instructions are meant for the `CODEOWNERS` of the repository who actually create new repositories for PyLadies Chapters website.

## Checklist

- Review open issue, confirming no information is overlooked (e.g. what template they want to use if any, where the website should be hosted, the GitHub handles of organizers, etc.)
- Create a new repository with the convention `pyladies-chaptername-website` e.g. `pyladies-chicago-website` using the template, if one is specified. If none is specified but a prexisting website exists the organizers want to port over, fork their repo and follow the convention for the repo name.
- Create a PyLadies organizer team, the parent team should ne `Organizers` and the name of the team the name of the chapter e.g. `@pyladies/chicago`, add that team to the `CODEOWNERS` for the repo
- Add the PyLadies organizer team to the repo with maintainer privileges (one step beneath admin)
- Handle the balance of the open questions including those related to the subdomain creation, hosting, and any CI support (e.g. Netlify) 

## Does the issue ask for Netlify CI support?

**To use Netlify CI the website _must_ include the Netlify badge on it. See pyladies.com footer for example. This is to be in compliance with the PyLadies free OSS account plan.**

- Navigate to `app.netlify.com`, selecting the PyLadies OSS Account, you'll need to add the new repository clicking `new site from git` and find the repository under `pyladies` organization. If you aren't a member of the Netlify account, ask in Slack in `#project-tech-infa`.
- If this is a website that has a more complex build than simple HTML confirm the project details under the `build command`
- When it looks good using the `gh-pages` branch to deploy from with whatever `build command` needed, deploy! Use the output to confirm if it is successful. Tip: We are using Python 3.7 for build so make sure the repo has a `runtime.txt` with the value `3.7` in it on the `gh-pages` branch.
- Rename the site deploy to something useful (find under the `General` setting)

## Does the issue ask for hosting on GitHub pages?

Great make sure the repo has a `gh-pages` branch as that is the branch used to serve up the website via GitHub pages, likely best if that is the default branch

## Wire up the subdomain

Using the hosting directions specified in the issue, add the subdomain to the PyLadies Cloudflare

## Questions?

Ask in `project-tech-infa` in the PyLadies Slack.
